# Horiseon Webpage Refactor

## Description

In order to deepen my understanding my understanding of how HTML, I refactored code for the Horiseon webpage for better readability within the HTML and CSS. Within the Horiseon Webpage, I found that many of the HTML elements used were non-semantic. This can make it unclear for other developers to discern different parts of the webpage. By adding semantic HTML elements, I was able to improve upon the readability of base code for the Horiseon. As I made changes to the HTML document, I made sure to reflect the changes within the HTML document as well so that the website looks visibly the same.
